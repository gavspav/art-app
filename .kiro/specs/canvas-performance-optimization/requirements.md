# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical performance issues in the generative art application's canvas rendering and animation systems. The current implementation suffers from excessive re-renders and direct state mutations that cause performance degradation and potential bugs, especially with multiple layers or complex animations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user creating complex generative art with multiple layers, I want smooth canvas rendering performance, so that I can work with many layers without experiencing lag or stuttering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN layers are updated THEN the canvas SHALL only re-render when visual properties actually change
2. WHEN non-visual properties change THEN the canvas SHALL NOT trigger unnecessary re-renders
3. WHEN multiple layers are present THEN the rendering performance SHALL remain smooth (>30 FPS)
4. WHEN expensive calculations are performed THEN they SHALL be memoized to prevent redundant computation
5. IF a layer's visual properties haven't changed THEN that layer SHALL NOT be redrawn

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user animating shapes, I want consistent and predictable animation behavior, so that my generative art animations work reliably without unexpected glitches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animation updates occur THEN layer objects SHALL be immutably updated without direct mutations
2. WHEN boundary collisions happen THEN new angle calculations SHALL return new objects rather than mutating existing ones
3. WHEN animation state changes THEN the previous state SHALL remain unchanged to prevent side effects
4. WHEN multiple layers animate simultaneously THEN each layer's state SHALL be independently managed
5. IF animation parameters change THEN the transition SHALL be smooth without state corruption

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the codebase, I want clean separation between rendering logic and state management, so that performance optimizations don't break existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performance optimizations are implemented THEN existing component APIs SHALL remain unchanged
2. WHEN canvas rendering is optimized THEN all current visual features SHALL continue to work identically
3. WHEN animation logic is refactored THEN all movement styles and behaviors SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN memoization is added THEN it SHALL not interfere with real-time parameter updates
5. IF optimization introduces complexity THEN it SHALL be properly documented and tested

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user working with the application, I want responsive controls and immediate visual feedback, so that parameter changes are reflected instantly without delay.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I adjust a parameter THEN the visual change SHALL be reflected within 16ms (60 FPS)
2. WHEN I modify layer properties THEN only affected visual elements SHALL update
3. WHEN I interact with controls THEN the UI SHALL remain responsive during canvas updates
4. WHEN I add or remove layers THEN the performance impact SHALL be minimal
5. IF the canvas is complex THEN control responsiveness SHALL not be affected
