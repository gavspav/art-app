# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current CodePen art application exists as a single large file with over 600 lines of code, making it difficult to maintain, test, and work with. This refactor will break down the monolithic structure into a modular, well-organized React application that follows modern development practices and makes it easier for LLMs to work on individual components.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application code to be organized into logical modules, so that I can easily locate and modify specific functionality without navigating through a massive single file.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN the application SHALL be split into separate files with clear responsibilities
2. WHEN examining the project structure THEN each component SHALL have a single, well-defined purpose
3. WHEN working on a specific feature THEN the related code SHALL be contained within its own module or component file
4. WHEN the application runs THEN it SHALL maintain all existing functionality without any behavioral changes

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the parameter configuration system to be separated from the main application logic, so that parameter management can be modified independently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN parameter definitions SHALL be in a separate configuration file
2. WHEN parameter logic is updated THEN it SHALL not require changes to the main application component
3. WHEN new parameters are added THEN they SHALL follow a consistent structure defined in the parameter system
4. WHEN the parameter system is used THEN it SHALL provide the same functionality as the current implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the canvas animation logic to be isolated from the UI components, so that rendering logic can be maintained separately from user interface concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN canvas drawing functions SHALL be in separate utility modules
2. WHEN animation logic is modified THEN it SHALL not require changes to React components
3. WHEN the canvas renders THEN it SHALL use the same algorithms and produce identical visual output
4. WHEN performance optimizations are needed THEN they SHALL be implementable within the isolated animation modules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI components to be broken down into smaller, focused components, so that each component has a single responsibility and can be easily tested and modified.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN the SettingsPanel SHALL be split into logical sub-components
2. WHEN UI components are rendered THEN each SHALL handle only its specific UI concern
3. WHEN a component needs to be modified THEN changes SHALL be isolated to that component's file
4. WHEN components are reused THEN they SHALL be easily importable and composable

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration management (save/load) to be handled by dedicated modules, so that persistence logic is separated from UI presentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN save/load functionality SHALL be in separate service modules
2. WHEN configuration data is persisted THEN it SHALL use the same localStorage mechanisms as currently implemented
3. WHEN configuration operations are performed THEN they SHALL provide the same user experience as the current implementation
4. WHEN new configuration features are added THEN they SHALL integrate cleanly with the separated service layer

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to follow modern React patterns and project structure conventions, so that it's easier for other developers and LLMs to understand and contribute to the codebase.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN the project SHALL follow standard React project structure conventions
2. WHEN examining the codebase THEN imports and exports SHALL be clearly organized and consistent
3. WHEN custom hooks are used THEN they SHALL be properly separated into their own files
4. WHEN the application is built THEN it SHALL maintain the same build process and output as the current version

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored code to maintain all existing functionality, so that users experience no changes in behavior or features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN all current features SHALL work identically to the original implementation
2. WHEN users interact with the application THEN they SHALL see no difference in behavior, performance, or visual output
3. WHEN the application is tested THEN all existing functionality SHALL pass validation
4. WHEN edge cases are encountered THEN they SHALL be handled the same way as in the original implementation

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the new project structure to be created as a modern Vite-based React application in its own directory, so that the refactored code uses modern tooling and doesn't interfere with the existing CodePen implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactor begins THEN a new Vite project directory SHALL be created separate from existing files
2. WHEN the new structure is implemented THEN it SHALL use Vite as the build tool and development server
3. WHEN the application is developed THEN it SHALL benefit from Vite's fast hot module replacement and modern build optimizations
4. WHEN the refactor is complete THEN both versions SHALL be able to coexist in the workspace
5. WHEN the new version is ready THEN it SHALL be easily deployable as a modern web application with optimized builds
